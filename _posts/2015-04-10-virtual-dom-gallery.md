title: Virtual DOM Gallery
---

Welcome to the [Virtual DOM Gallery](//virtualdom.gallery), a showcase for the powerful new way to write reusable components that [virtual DOM](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) enables.

User interface widgets and libraries that use virtual DOM can interoperate with any existing framework with practically no changes. This means that a useful snippet of code is open to a wider audience, and relies on simple standard Web concepts of vanilla JavaScript, DOM and CSS to interoperate with the host application and other components. No framework-specific lock-in, no learning curve, all modular and reusable.
