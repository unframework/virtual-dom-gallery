title: Virtual DOM Gallery
---

Welcome to the [Virtual DOM Gallery](//virtualdom.gallery), a showcase for the powerful new way to write reusable components enabled by [virtual DOM](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom).

User interface widgets and libraries that use virtual DOM can interoperate with any existing framework with practically no changes. This means that a useful snippet of code is open to a wider audience, and relies on nothing but simple standard Web concepts of vanilla JavaScript, DOM and CSS to interoperate with the host application and other components. No framework-specific lock-in, no learning curve, simply modular and reusable.
