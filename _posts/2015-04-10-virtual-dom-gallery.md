title: Virtual DOM Gallery
---

Welcome to the [Virtual DOM Gallery](//virtualdom.gallery), a showcase for the powerful new way to write reusable components enabled by [virtual DOM](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom).

User interface widgets and libraries that use virtual DOM can interoperate with any existing framework with practically no changes. No lock-in, no niche learning curve, simply modular and reusable JavaScript and CSS.

[This gallery](//virtualdom.gallery) will feature interesting and useful new virtual DOM components as well as links to guides and libraries for writing them and embedding them in larger frameworks like AngularJS, Backbone, EmberJS and ReactJS. Contributions and submissions are encouraged!
