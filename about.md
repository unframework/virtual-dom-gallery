[Virtual DOM gallery](//virtualdom.gallery/) features interesting and useful new virtual DOM components as well as links to guides and libraries for writing them and embedding them in larger frameworks like AngularJS, Backbone, EmberJS and ReactJS. Contributions and submissions are encouraged!

User interface widgets and libraries that use [virtual DOM](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) can interoperate with any existing framework with practically no changes. No lock-in, no niche learning curve, simply modular and reusable JavaScript and CSS.

We (<a href="https://twitter.com/unframework">@unframework</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/atesgoral">@atesgoral</a>) are in awe of all the possibilities that this creates and tirelessly scour the Web for new widgets and effects implemented in virtual DOM to help promote this tech. [Tweet at us](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@unframework%20check%20this%20out) to suggest things to check out!
